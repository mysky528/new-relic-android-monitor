# new-relic-android-monitor
Are you already using New Relic? That's great! Its mails and alarms are great. But... you and me know that, sometimes, they're ignored.

We managed to create this great app to monitor your New Relic applications Apdex and <b>DISTURB YOU</b> when they're not on the target threshold. You only need to paste a tablet to a wall, and watch the beautiful Andy's banana or a <b>DISTURBING WHITE OVER RED BLINKING MESSAGE</b>.

The app has been developed on a great [InfoJobs](https://www.infojobs.net) lab day. So, it doesn't have a settings screen where you can find a beautiful place to write your api key. Instead of that, you must set a variable in your desired gradle.properties with something like:
```
NEW_RELIC_API_KEY_MONITOR=42cf684cb1b1304b55b72b4n4n420256730c01049783931
```

Oh! Two simple pictures to introduce the solution :)

We're open to issues reporting, new functionalities and whatever you need. By the way, we also expect some great Pull Requests with that features! :D
